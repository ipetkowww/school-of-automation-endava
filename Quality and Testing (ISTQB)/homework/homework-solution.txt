7. Explain the procedure for manual testing?
- firstly we have to analyze/read the requirements of the feature that we are going to test
- we have to crate a clear and descriptive test plan
- we have to write clear and descrptive test cases which covers all the requirements that we already read in the first step
- we are executing the test cases and if we find defect, we must raised them (defect also must be clear and descriptive)
- we have to create report if it's needed
- after the raised defect are fixed, we must re-test the test cases in order to verify that defects are not reproducible anymore.
