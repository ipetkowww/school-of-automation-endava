1) B => because static analysis tools can help them to test any form of document including source code, design documents and models,
functional specifications and requirement specifications.

2) C => because only in that answer the states of the system is incorrect. It's not possible to Logout from Basket page.
Based on the diagram, firstly you have to PAY and then LOGOUT.

3) Б => in order to get 100% decision coverage we have to go through all possible decisions (if-else) statements!

4) C => Becaseu the added code will be executed always whatever the outcome of the if-else statement and it's not needed to add any additional tests.

5) A => because only that answers contains the VALID result based on the provided decision table.
The answer is for Rule 2. 21-29 y.o. / Insurance class: A or B / Premium: 90 / Excess: 2,500

6) B => because if you have the needed knowledge of the system, it will be easier for you to find defects and also 
you can predict the area where bug can occur after developers do some changes/fixes.

7) 

8) A => because black box techniques check the application under test from the user’s perspective.
These techniques are focused on the input that goes into the software, and the output that is produced.
Also black box technique are mainly based on specification.
For example: white box techniques are based on the code.


9) D => because some tools of the static analysis are mainly focused on enforcment of coding standards.

10) A => because we need to go through ONLY the if statements to provide full statement coverage! It's not needed to go through else statements

11) C =>

12) B => because if you want to have complete statement and branch coverage you have to test every statement and every branch in the program (code).

13) A => because the objective of the testing is to identifying bugs and not fixing defects (the process of fixing defects is called debugging).

14) A => because if the specification is outdated, we can use our experience and apply experience-based testing in order to find new defects.

15) C => because for 100% statement coverage is needed to go through all if statements and in our case they are only 2.
